# Comp-O

Comp-O is a minimal OWL-S extension for describing component-based services.

The ontology documentation is available at [https://comp-o.github.io/comp-o/](https://comp-o.github.io/comp-o/).

## Possible uses

This ontology can be used to (but not only) assist the developer in the building of complex composite services and the dynamic generation of semantic composite services description.

These uses have been explored and implemented in a [POC published on GitHub](https://github.com/comp-o/comp-o-poc).
